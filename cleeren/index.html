                    <h3 id="history">Our History</h3>
                    <p> For many years, <strong>Bethany</strong> has been baking pies at her home. But in 2013, we opened our first store in St. Louis, MO, in the historic Dogtown neighborhood. And quickly people from all over the Midwest fell in love with our soft cakes, heavenly cheesecakes, spicy apple pies, and so much more!
                    <br><br>
                    <strong style="color: #9a88c0"> Bethany's Pie Shop</strong> was nationally recognized in no time, and the cozy little Dogtown shop was quickly outgrown. In 2015, while maintaining the original Dogtown storefront, we moved into a larger space to accomodate the rapidly expanding business of baking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And now we're ready to take on the world, right from here. With this new digital store, you can order a <strong style="color: #9a88c0"> Bethany's Pie Shop</strong> treat <em><strong>from anywhere</strong></em> and have it sent <em><strong>to anywhere</strong></em> and you can do this <em><strong>whenever you feel like it!</strong></em>

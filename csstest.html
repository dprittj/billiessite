                On April 26th, 2018, a nearly four year old pup, Billie, was rescued from a local Humane Society and brought home to join her new family. Ever slowly since then, with a gruff voice and a wry sense of humor, Billie has let much emerge about her past, including, but not limited to:

                </li>
                <li>
                    -her successful chain of restaurants called Billie's and their trademark Billie-que Sauce;
                </li>
                <li>
                    -that she is also a doctor and a lawyer;

                <li>
                    -that one day she spent as a river barge captain (with Bigfoot as her first mate);
                </li>
                <li>-and more!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="aboutbillie">
                Everyday we are learning much more about Billie: qualities of great business acumen, a dark past, crime-fighting skills, great travels, and perhaps even some international dealings...

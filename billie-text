    BILLIE DOG, aka Stinky, aka StinkyDog, aka Dr. Billie Billieshaw, aka Billie-pup, aka Billikin...

The Billie story:
    A formerly abandoned dog, aged 4, is rescued from a Humane Society of America location in Maryland Heights, MO on April 26, 2018. Named "Bella" by her previous owners (or the Humane Society staff), "Bella", while beautiful, good natured, and very sweet, did not otherwise appear to take to her namesake. She indeed felt a little more mysterious, edgy, perhaps even more legendary than a "Bella", and quickly she found her proper name, Billie, suited her much better. "Billie" encompassed not only her accurate qualities of her previous name but also all of the new, emerging qualities she had been harboring: qualities of great business acumen, a dark past, crime-fighting skills, great travels, and perhaps even some international dealings...

New Endeavor:
    And at the senior age of 9, Billie looks into potentially branching out and adding to her many skills, life experiences, and wondrous stories... this time as a computer programmer! Let's look around at the new tricks this old Billie Dog is learning...

CSS:
    This is Billie's HTML-CSS testing grounds, playing with elements, tags, styles, cascading rules, inheritance, attributes, and more. Billie is not sure design is in her bones, but she's working on getting her paws dirty with knowing the core concepts.

JavaScript:
    This is Billie's HTML-JavaScript playground. Billie really loves to play and has a lot of fun testing JS concepts to create new toys and fields to run around in.
